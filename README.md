### Heavily Obfuscated SHA-256 Password Hasher  
**Made by Bhargav Todimela**

This project provides a heavily obfuscated Python script that securely collects a password from the user and encrypts it using **SHA-256**.  
The script is deeply obfuscated using **zlib compression** and **Base64 packing** for demonstration, protection, or security research purposes.
